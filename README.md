## Local Data Source

This package helps to painlessly integrate boilerplate-proof Hive-based local data source secured by
implementation of flutter_secure_storage.

## Features

Uses basic CRUD operations based on hive(noSql) for light database models mostly. Secured by
flutter_secure_storage. Uniquely type defined(every model entity / runtime type, corresponds to only
one entity in hive, defined by TypeAdapter).

## Getting started

Before initializing LocalDataSource make sure you have all hive types with its' type adapters
generated with "flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-issues". Adjust according to
an issue.

## Usage

Run LocalDataSource.init with security key generated by you, map of all type-to-typeAdapter entities
and you are ready to go.
